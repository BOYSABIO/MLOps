Requirements for the Project:
Choose your group members:
6 groups of 6 ppl
2 groups of 5 (first come, first serve)
Select one project (Jupyter notebook) you'll be working from:
One Jupyter notebook you'll be putting into production (smtg you have already worked in the past)
Select a simple yet comprehensive project/ Notebook (it will explode in complexity!). "Comprehensive", so you can split it into different modules:
- Data loading
- Simple EDA
- Pre-processing and wrangling
- Feature Engineering
- Model Training
- Model Testing
- Model evaluation
Ensure you have enought data for a good Training-Validaton-Test split (We'll simulate test data for serving purposes)
Ensure you can build a powerful use case around it i.e. you can develiver value from it
